## Control Flow Connections

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User opens application
2. App.tsx checks authentication state
3. Redirects to Login.tsx if not authenticated
4. Login.tsx handles credential submission
5. POST to server/routes.ts /api/auth/login
6. server/routes.ts calls connection-manager.ts
7. connection-manager.ts validates with john_login_user
8. Role credentials extracted from Users table
9. Role-specific connection created
10. Session stored in role-based-storage.ts
11. Success response to client
12. App.tsx redirects to Dashboard.tsx
```

### Data Operation Flow
```
1. User interacts with page component
2. Component uses TanStack Query hooks
3. API request via client/lib/queryClient.ts
4. server/routes.ts receives request
5. Route handler calls role-based-storage.ts
6. Storage method uses session connection
7. SQL query executed with role permissions
8. Results returned through chain
9. Component updates UI
10. Cache updated for future requests
```

### Error Handling Flow
```
1. Error occurs at any level
2. Caught by appropriate error boundary
3. Error propagated up through layers
4. User-friendly message displayed
5. Logging for debugging
6. Recovery options provided
```

## Security Implementation

### Connection Isolation
- Each user session has dedicated database connection
- Role-based permissions enforced at SQL Server level
- No shared state between user sessions

### Input Validation
- All inputs validated with Zod schemas
- Parameterized SQL queries prevent injection
- Type safety throughout application

### Authentication Security
- Two-tier authentication prevents privilege escalation
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Automatic session cleanup on logout

This documentation provides comprehensive understanding of how each component works and connects to create a secure, scalable inventory management system.
